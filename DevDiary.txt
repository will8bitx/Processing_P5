--Documentation Reference - This value is set by the first parameter of the size() function. For example, the function call size(320, 240) sets the width variable to the value 320. The value of width defaults to 100 if size() is not used in a program.

To accomplish what I needed I had to double scale, since the scale acts as a multiplier when added to the code, doubling it ups reduces the size of the 3rd sphere by 4x.
